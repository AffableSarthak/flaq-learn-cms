Simply put, Web3 wallets are a way to use hardware or software not only to access funds, but to effortlessly allow you to interact with decentralized applications, serve as a gateway to bankless financial services, collect NFTs, create on-chain identity, collaborate with communities, and provide substantially more use cases beyond the scope of the traditional wallets we have today. Just like how people have a physical wallet to store paper money, these wallets help store access to your digital currency instead. In addition, Web3 wallets are capable of storing digital assets such as NFTs and enable users to interact with Decentralized Apps (dApps). This is done all without the necessity of a middleman involved. Wallets don’t actually store the cryptocurrency, but they store the information required for access to your funds which are digital cryptocurrencies.",
